# Advent-of-Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

LockDown Fun Just for a bit of lockdown fun thought, I would dust of my old C# skills.

Probably not the best or most efficient code, might go back and refine later, (or try in Rust, haskell, Dart or Python...) but gets all the right answers...

Lots of skills to practice (well, I used all these....) File and IO functions String manipulation single, 2d and 3d arrays Binary data manipulation Recursice functions (lots of...) Regex functions Vectors Hastables Lists, queues, stacks and dictionaries Images (as arrays) Data searching and analysing Encryption
