* Day 01 - No Time for a Taxicab: 
* Day 02 - Bathroom Security: 
* Day 03 - Squares With Three Sides:
* Day 04 - Security Through Obscurity:
* Day 05 - How About a Nice Game of Chess?:
* Day 06 - Signals and Noise:
* Day 07 - Internet Protocol Version 7:
* Day 08 - Two-Factor Authentication:
* Day 09 - Explosives in Cyberspace:
* Day 10 - Balance Bots
* Day 11 - Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators: Find optimum path, Solved 3 ways. 1. Maths (not mine) 2. Greedy 3. A*
* Day 12 - Leonardo's Monorail: Registers and instruction, initially Regex (too slow even +compiled) switch to std IO Split (faster)
* Day 13 - A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles: Simpler version of the A* Algorithm used in day 11
* Day 14 - One-Time Pad: MD5 hashing matching patterns (Part 2 very slow, using parallel threads but needs some work....)
* Day 15 - Timing is Everything: Align a set of classes based on time to get optimum path
* Day 16 - Dragon Checksum: Make data and checksum for disc overwrite, string manipulation, substitution, and string builder
* Day 17 - Two Steps Forward: Greedy checking of all posible routes to vault using recursive function
* Day 18 - Like a Rogue: Use last pattern to create new row, very slow on Part 2
* Day 19 - An Elephant Named Joseph: Match patterns and create simple equations to get result
* Day 20 - Firewall Rules: Search ranges (or gaps)
* Day 21 - Scrambled Letters and Hash: String manipulation, added to string extensions
* Day 22 - Grid Computing: Double A* Algorithm to navigate cluster nodes to move data
* Day 23 - Safe Cracking: Part1 read instructions, Part2 look at data to manageg loops and address with code
* Day 24 - Air Duct Spelunking: A* Part1 on work out best route, Part2 work out best route to get back to start
* Day 25 - Clock Signal: Check what output meets the 101010... output by loopoing register input
