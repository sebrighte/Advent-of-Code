* Day 03 - Squares With Three Sides:
* Day 04 - Security Through Obscurity:
* Day 05 - How About a Nice Game of Chess?:
* Day 06 - Signals and Noise:
* Day 07 - Internet Protocol Version 7:
* Day 08 - Two-Factor Authentication:
* Day 09 - Explosives in Cyberspace:
* Day 10 - Balance Bots
* Day 11 - Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators: Find optimum path, Solved 3 ways. 1. Maths (not mine) 2. Greedy 3. A*
* Day 12 - Leonardo's Monorail: Registers and instruction, initially Regex (too slow even +compiled) switch to std IO Split (faster)
* Day 13 - A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles: Simpler version of the A* Algorithm used in day 11
* Day 14 - One-Time Pad: MD5 hashing matching patterns (Part 2 very slow, using parallel threads but needs some work....)
* Day 15 - Timing is Everything: Align a set of classes based on time to get optimum path

* Day 17 - Two Steps Forward: Greedy checking of all posible routes to vault using recursive function
* Day 18 - Like a Rogue: Use last pattern to create new row, very slow on Part 2
* Day 19 - An Elephant Named Joseph: Match patterns and create simple equations to get result
* Day 20 - Firewall Rules: Search ranges (or gaps)
* Day 21 - Scrambled Letters and Hash: String manipulation, added to string extensions
* Day 22 - Grid Computing: Double A* Algorithm to navigate cluster nodes to move data
* Day 23 - 
* Day 24 - 
* Day 25 -
